<h1>Horses, Sharks and Hearts</h1>

<p>We carry a silent intelligence in our chests — an ever-present hum that remembers joy, grief, courage. But how often do we actually listen?</p>
<p>Our modern lives push us to look outward — at data, deadlines, diagnoses. We forget that our hearts store stories, sense shifts in our own energy, and whisper warnings.</p>
<p>Horses can pick up on a human’s heartbeat from several feet away and are known to synchronise with it in calm or distress. Their entire body listens.</p>
<p>Sharks, using electroreceptors called ampullae of Lorenzini, can detect the faint electric field of a beating heart — even without seeing it. It’s not about aggression. It’s about awareness.</p>
<p>What if we leaned into the subtle? A few breaths asking, what’s my chest saying right now? A moment of stillness to catch the tremble of emotion before our mind labels it. This is heart-healing — not fixing, but tuning. Learning that being aware is a gift.</p>
<p>And here, the shark’s gift to us isn’t a fearful lesson — it’s an invitation. Sharks don’t judge. They sense. They pause at the unfamiliar. What would it look like if we did the same?</p>
<p>In this gentle reckoning, heart-healing becomes a shared current — an echo across species — that whispers: feel first, then move.</p>
